# A simple website showing some of my basic skills in Bootsrap, Flask, CSS

The website was intended to use a scroll down page, for easier use on mobile.

Next on the agenda and how it will be improved:
1. Implement a database, that houses work, volunteer and other experiences

2. Clicking on any experience will bring up and generate a new page, that will retrieve data from the database.

3. Create headers and footers, so that the webpage is easier manipulated

4. implement email function, that can send an email of anyonme trying to contact me using WTForms

5. Implement the language learning tool into the webpage, using once a database of most commonly used words
